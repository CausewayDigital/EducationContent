# Activity 1 - Which one is right?


## Step 1
Check which one of the commands written on the computer monitors is correct and shows **"Hi"** on the screen. There should be no syntax errors shown when the code is run, press the mouse button on the right side of the monitor in the game. Click on the hints if you need help.

The command structure in Minecraft python looks like:
```block 
command_group.command_name()
```

## Step 2
Go over to the first computer, the one by the entrance with the blue flower on the desk. Write out what is written on the monitor in the coding window: 
```block 
player(say)Hi```
Run the code to check if it's correct. If it is, press the mouse button. If it's not, try the other 3 pieces of code on the remaining monitors.

Clear the coding window by using the **reset** button, by talking to the developer, if you don't get the correct outcome. 

## Step 3 
If you have selected the correct piece of code the door will open to the next activity. If you haven't bugs will appear, keep trying until you find the correct code.
