### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Check which one of the commands written on the computer monitors is correct and shows **"Hi"** on the screen when run.
There should be no syntax errors shown when the code is run. Press the mouse button on the right side of the monitor in the game if the code runs correctly.
Click on the hints if you need help.

The command structure in Minecraft python is:

command_group.command_name()

## Step 2

Go over to the first computer, the one by the entrance with the blue flower on the desk. Write out what is written on the monitor in the coding window:

```python 
player(say)Hi 
```
Run the code to check if it's correct. If it is, press the mouse button. If it's not, try the other 3 pieces of code on the remaining monitors.

If you want to clear the coding window use the **reset** button by talking to the developer. 

## Step 3 
If you have found the correct piece of code and preesed the mouse buttton, the door will open to the next activity. If you haven't bugs will appear, keep trying until you find the correct code.
