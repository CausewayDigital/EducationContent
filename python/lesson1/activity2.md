# Activity 2 - Whats missing?

### @explicitHints true

```python
player.say()
```

## Step 1
Find out what syntax is missing from the codes on the tv monitors, then place the mathcing syntax blocks on the gold in front.
Check the command syntax by using the `||player: say||` command from the `||player:player||` group on the left side of the coding window.

## Step 2
Take the needed syntax blocks from the chest. Go over to the first tv monitor, by the entrance, there is one piece of syntax missing from the command on the monitor: 
```python
player.say"To show")
```
Place the missing syntax block. The command for the second tv monitor also has a piece of syntax missing, place the missing syntax block for that command. 

## Step 3 
Go over to tv monitor number three, there are two pieces of syntax missing from the command on that monitor: 
```python
player.say(the screen)
```
Place the missing syntax blocks. The command on the fourth tv monitor also has two pieces of syntax missing, place the missing syntax blocks for that command.

Use the coding window at any point to check if the command works.

## Step 4
A number can be used in different ways. To show its character, using quotes, or to show its mathematical value, without quotes. 
Go over to the fifth tv monitor, there is syntax missing from the command on the monitor. 
This command needs to displey the character of the number. Place the missing syntax blocks. 

## Step 5
The sixth tv monitor also has syntax missing, place the missing syntax blocks for that command so that it displays the mathematical value of the number. 

## Step 6 
If you have completed each command correctly the door will open to the next activity. If not, bugs will appear. Keep trying until you find the correct code.

Clear the coding window by using the **try again** button, by talking to the developer, if you don't get the correct outcome.
