# Activity 2 - Whats missing?

### @explicitHints true

```python
player.say()
```

## Step 1
Find out what syntax is missing from the codes on the tv monitors, then place the matching syntax blocks on the gold in front.
Check the command syntax by using the `||player: say||` command from the `||player:player||` group on the left side of the coding window.

## Step 2
Take the needed syntax blocks from the chest. Go over to the first tv monitor, by the entrance. There is one piece of syntax missing from the command on the monitor: 
```python
# @highlight
player.say"To show")
```
Place the missing syntax block. The command on the second tv monitor also has a piece of syntax missing, place the missing syntax. 

## Step 3 
Go over to third tv monitor, there are two pieces of syntax missing from the command: 

```python
# @highlight
player.say(the screen)
```

Place the missing syntax blocks. The command on the fourth tv monitor also has two pieces of syntax missing, place the missing syntax blocks. 

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Run the code to check if the command works.

## Step 4
Numbers can be used in different ways. To be shown as a piece of **text**, using quotes, or to be used as a **mathematical value**, without quotes. 
Go to the fifth tv monitor, there is syntax missing from the command on the monitor. 
This command needs to display the number as a piece of **text**. Place the missing syntax blocks. 

## Step 5
The command on the sixth tv monitor also has syntax missing. This command needs to display the number as a **mathematical value**. Place the missing syntax blocks.
