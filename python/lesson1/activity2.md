# Activity 2 - Whats missing?

### @explicitHints true

```python
player.say()
```

## Step 1
Find out what is missing from the codes on the tv monitors, then place the syntax blocks that are missing on the gold blocks in front. Check the command syntax by finding the command in the `||player:player||` tab on the left side of the coding window. This tab has the same name as the command group of the command. 

## Step 2
Take the needed syntax blocks from the chest. Go over to the first tv monitor, by the entrance, here you will see that one syntax block is missing in the command: 
```python
player.say"To show")
```
Do you know which one? The next tv monitor on the right also has one syntax block missing. 

## Step 3 
Go over to the next pair of tv monitors, on the next wall on the right, here you will see that two syntax blocks are missing in the command: 
```python
player.say(the screen)
```
Do you know which ones? The next tv monitor on the right also has two syntax blocks missing.

Use the coding window at any point to check if the command works.

## Step 4
A number can be used in different ways. To show its character, using quotes, or to show its mathematical value, without quotes. Go over to the next pair of tv monitors, on the next wall to the right, here you will see that there are syntax blocks missing on the first tv monitor. Do you know which ones? The next tv monitor on the right also has syntax blocks missing. 

## Step 5 
If you have completed each command correctly the door will open to the next activity. If not, bugs will appear. Keep trying until you find the correct code.

Clear the coding window by using the try again button, by talking to the developer, if you don't get the correct outcome.
