# Activity 2 - Whats missing?

### @explicitHints true

```python
player.say()
```

## Step 1
Find out whats missing from the computer monitors, then place the syntax block thats missing from the monitor on the gold block in front. Check the command syntax by finding the command in the tab on the left side of the coding window. This tab will have the same name as the command group of the command.

## Step 2

Take the needed syntax blocks from the chest. Go over to the first monitor, by the entrance, here you will see that one syntax block is missing in the command:
```python
player.say"To show")
```

Do you know which one? The next monitor on the right also has one syntax block missing.

## Step 3 
Go over to the next pair of monitors, on the next wall on the right, here you will see that two syntax blocks are missing in the command:
```python
player.say(the screen)
```
Do you know which ones? The next monitor on the right also has two syntax blocks missing.

Use the coding window at any point to check if the command works.

## Step 4
A number can be used in different ways. To show its character, using quotes, or to show its mathematical value, without quotes. Go over to the next pair of monitors, on the next wall to the right, here you will see that there are syntax blocks missing on the first monitor. Do you know which ones? The next monitor on the right also has syntax blocks missing.

### ~ tutorialhint
Clear the coding window by using the **try again** button, by talking to the developer, if you don't get the correct outcome.
