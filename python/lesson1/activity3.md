# Activity 3 - What's the correct number?

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1
To use the mathematical value of a number in a command, it should be typed **without** any quotes. So, if we typed the command: 
```python
player.say(1+1) 
```
This would show the number 2 in the chat. However, if we typed the same thing but with quotes, we would get the characters, 1+1, shown in the chat:  
```python
player.say("1+1") 
```

## Step 3 
Go over to the first tv monitor, by the entrance, here you will see the command: 
```python
player.say("45+2505") 
```
Try it out in the coding window, chose the correct answer.  

## Step 4
Go over to the next tv monitor, on the right, here you will see the command: 
```python
player.say("830/10") 
```
What is the correct answer?  

## Step 5 
Go over to the next tv monitor, on the right, here you will see the command: 
```python
player.say("(2+6)*(4-2)") 
```
What is the correct answer? 

## Step 6
If you have chosen each correct answer correctly congratulations, you have finished the lesson. If not, bugs will appear. Keep trying until you find the correct code.

Clear the coding window by using the try again button, by talking to the developer, if you don't get the correct outcome.
