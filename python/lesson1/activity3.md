### @explicitHints true


## Step 1
To use the mathematical value of numbers in a command, quotes should not be used. For example, if you run the command below, we will see the number 2 in the chat. 
Which is the calculated value of 1+1.
```python
player.say(1+1) 
```

## Step 2

Look at each of the tv monitors, calculate the sums using code.
See what number the code gives you in the chat. Chose the correct answer from one of the three numbers below the tv monitor, by pressing the button. 

## Step 3 
Go over to the first tv monitor, by the entrance, here you will see the sum: 
```python
45+2505 
```
What is the correct answer?

```python
player.say(45+2505)
```

## Step 4
In python to divide we use a slash **/**. Go over to the second tv monitor, here you will see the sum: 
```python
830/10
```
What is the correct answer?
### ~ tutorialhint
```python
player.say(830/10) 
```

## Step 5 
While for multiplication we use a star ** * **. Go over to the third tv monitor, here you will see the sum: 
```python
(2+6)*(4-2)
```
What is the correct answer?
### ~ tutorialhint
```python
player.say((2+6)*(4-2)) 
```
