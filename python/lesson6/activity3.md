# Activity 3 -  Getting through. 

```python
agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD) 
agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
for i in range(2):
      pass
if True:
      pass
```

## Step 1
Write a code to make the Agent go through the obstacle course even though it doesnt know which block is where. To do this use the 
`||agent:agent detect||` command as conditions. 
### ~ tutorialhint 
Remember to use the **and** operator to check that two conditions are true. 

```template
//Replace with for loop set to 9                        
//Replace with else if conditional with agent detect condition 
//Make the agent move left                                 
//Replace with elif conditional with agent detect condition 
//Make the agent move right
//Replace with else part of the else if conditional             
//Make the agent move forward                                  
//End of loop                                       
```
