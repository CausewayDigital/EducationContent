# Activity 3 - Are my calculations off?

```python
player.say("hi")
item +=1

```

## Step 1
Look at the first tv monitor and calculate the sum shown by creating a new variable called **cost**. Run the code to show the total cost in the chat.
Press the correlating button for that number, below the tv monitor. 

## Step 2
Look at the second tv monitor. You now need to add a new crop, pumpkin. Do this by declaring a variable called **pumpkin** and then giving it a value
that's the same as the difference of the variables **berries** and **apple**. Add the new variable **pumpkin** to the variable **cost**. Then run the 
code and press the correct button. 

## Step 3 
Look at the last tv monitor, the value of the crops apple and melon have now changed. Account for this change in your code by using the
`||variables:change||` command after the variable **tax**.

```template
apple = 10
melon = 15
berries = 20
//replace with pumpkin variable | Step 2
tax = 2
//replace with apple change | Step 3
//replace with melon change | Step 3
//replace with cost variable | Step 1
player.say(cost)
```
