blocks.place()
```
# Activity 2 - Ideal planting spot.

## Step 1
Look at each of the **5** different location variables and see what crops are at these coordinates. Then create
**5** `||blocks: place block at position||` commands ,with either **PUMPKIN** or **MELON_BLOCK**, at the correct location variable 
to match the crop at the coordinate. 

### ~ tutorialhint
blocks.place(**crop type**, **location variable**)

```template
location1 = world(-24, 40, -18)
location2 = world(-31, 40, -11)
location3 = world(-28, 40, -16)
location4 = world(-25, 40, -13)
location5 = world(-31, 40, -17)

// replace with place block at location1 command
// replace with place block at location2 command
// replace with place block at location3 command
// replace with place block at location4 command
// replace with place block at location5 command
```
