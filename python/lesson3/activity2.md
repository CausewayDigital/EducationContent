blocks.place()
```
# Activity 2 - Ideal planting spot.

## Step 1
Look at each of the **5** different location variables and see what crops are at these coordinates. Then create
**5** `||blocks: place block at position||` commands ,with either **PUMPKIN** or **MELON_BLOCK**, at the correct location variable 
to match the crop at the coordinate. 

### ~ tutorialhint
blocks.place(**crop type**, **location variable**)

```template
location1 = world(24, 4, -18)
location2 = world(24, 5, -18)
location3 = world(24, 4, -18)
location4 = world(24, 4, -18)
location5 = world(24, 4, -18)

// replace with place block at location1 command
// replace with place block at location2 command
// replace with place block at location3 command
// replace with place block at location4 command
// replace with place block at location5 command
```
