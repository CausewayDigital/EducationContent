```python
for i in range(2):
pass
agent.collect_all()
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
agent.place(FORWARD)
agent.drop_all(FORWARD)
agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
```

## Step 1
Make a code so that the Agent will pick up the box and move it **6** blocks **forward** and then place it in front.

## Step 2
Edit the same code so that the Agent does the same thing but **4** times. Use a `||loops: for||` loop at the beginning. 
The barrells will be automatically stacked.
### ~ tutorialhint 
Dont for get to indent everything after the loop.
