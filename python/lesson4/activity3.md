# Activity 3 - Cleaning up.

```python
for i in range(2):
pass
agent.collect_all()
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
agent.place(FORWARD)
agent.drop_all(FORWARD)
agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
```

## Step 1
Make a code so that the Agent will go over every block of the small carpet and pickup dirt.

## Step 2
Edit the same code so that the Agent does the same thing but for the larger carpet. Do this by repeating the code before, **3** times,
using a `||loops:for||` loop. At the end make the Agent drop all of the dirt in the trash.
