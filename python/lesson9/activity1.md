# Activity 1 - Game controls.  

```python
agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
pos(0, 0, 0)
if True: 
    pass
else: 
    pass
elif:
    pass
while True:
    pass
```

## Step 1
There are two 'buttons' on the floor, blue is to control the Agent's left movement while red is to control the Agent's right. Write a code 
so that when you stand on the red or blue pads the Agent moves right or left.  
### ~ tutorialhint
A `||loops:while||` loop with the condition set to **True** or **1** will repeat infinitely. 

```template
//Replace with your functions below #
//Replace with comment about function below      
//Declare function                                
//If conditional with test for block condition (LIGHT_BLUE_CONCRETE)
//Make the Agent move right
//Elif conditional with test for block condition (RED_CONCRETE)
//Make the Agent move left
//Replace the lines below with your code #    
//Infinite while loop with True as condition 
//Call function                      
```
